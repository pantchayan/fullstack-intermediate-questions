<!-- Problem Description:

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate. 

In HTML:
1. footer contains:
    1.1. div.footer-parent element.
    1.2. p.footer-p element containing copyright info.
2. div.footer-parent element contains:
    2.1. ul.footer-text -> contains redirectable links
    2.2. ul.social-link -> contains social media logos inscribed in links

To acheive this you need to utlise Flexbox properties in the following manner.

For div.footer-parent:
1. Set the display to flex
2. And position the children elements across horizontal axis to 'space-between'

For ul.footer-text:
1. Set the display to flex
2. And position the children elements across horizontal axis to 'start'

For ul.social-link:
1. Set the display to flex
2. And position the children elements across horizontal axis to 'end'

<!-- Hint:

Make sure to not change the boileplate code.

In div.footer-parent, ul.footer-text & ul.social-link:
To set the children elements across horizontal axis, utilise justify-content property.
