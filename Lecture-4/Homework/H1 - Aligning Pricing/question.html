<!-- Problem Description:
Write internal CSS and determine flexbox properties of the Pricing Cards.

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate. 

In HTML:
1. section contains:
    1.1. h2 element with section heading
    1.2. div.cards-container
2. div.cards-container element contains:
    2.1. 3 div.card elements

The output should look like this:

<INSERT IMAGE>

To acheive this you need to utlise Flexbox properties in the following manner.

For section:
1. Set the display to flex
2. Set the main axis of flex as y-axis (column)
3. Align the items to center on the y-axis 

For div.cards-container:
1. Set the display to flex
2. And position the children elements across horizontal axis to 'space-evenly'

Further, you set flex-wrap property with value 'wrap' for div.cards-container to make the section responsive.
-->

<!-- Hint:
Follow the instructions in the problem description and test cases.
Make sure to not change the boileplate code.

For section:
To set the main axis of flex as y-axis, utilise flex-direction property and set its value as 'coloumn'
To align items to center on the y-axis, utilise align-items property and set its value as 'center'

For div.cards-container:
To set the children elements across horizontal axis to 'space-evenly', utilise justify-content property.-->

<!-- Test cases:
1. Verify that the section has display set as flex.
2. Verify that the flex-direction for section has value of 'column'.
3. Verify that the items inside section are aligned to center across y-axis.
4. Verify that the div.cards-container has display set as flex.
