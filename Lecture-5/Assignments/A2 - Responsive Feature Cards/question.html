<!-- Problem Description:
Write internal CSS to make the features section responsive

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate. 

In HTML:
1. section.features contains:
    1.1. h1 element
    1.2. div.container-parent
2. div.container-parent contains: (display set as flex)
    2.2. 3 div.containter elements that are the feature cards.

The output should look like this:

<INSERT IMAGE>

To acheive this you need to utlise media query in the following manner.

Add a media query for screens smaller than 940px, in which:
1. Using flex-direction, change the main-axis of the div.container-parent to y-axis
2. In the div.container-parent, align the items across cross-axis to center.

Note: smaller than 940px will have max-width set to 939px
-->

<!-- Hint:
Follow the instructions in the problem description and test cases.
Make sure to not change the boileplate code.

Use 
@media (max-width: 939px) {
    ...
}

to write the responsive CSS.

-->

<!-- Test cases:
1. Verify that a Media query for screens smaller than 940px (max-width: 939px) is written.
2. Verify that in that media query, div.container-parent has main-axis change to y-axis
3. Verify that in that media query, div.container-parent has items across the cross-axis aligned to center
