<!-- Problem Description:
Write internal CSS to make the features section responsive

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate. 

In HTML:
1. section contains:
    1.1. h2 element
    1.2. div.cards-container
2. div.cards-container contains: (display set as flex)
    2.2. 3 div.card elements that are the pricing cards.

The output should look like this:

<INSERT IMAGE>

To acheive this you need to utlise media query in the following manner.

Add a media query for screens smaller than 768px, in which:
1. Using flex-direction, change the main-axis of the div.cards-container to y-axis.
2. In the div.cards-container, align the items across cross-axis to center.

Note: smaller than 768px will have max-width set to 767px

<!-- Hint:
Follow the instructions in the problem description and test cases.
Make sure to not change the boileplate code.

Use 
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    ...
}

to write the responsive CSS.
