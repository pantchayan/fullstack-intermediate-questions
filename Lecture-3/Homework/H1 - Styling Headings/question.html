<!-- Problem Description:
Writing CSS to style the heading

What you are given?

You are provided with HTML and CSS boilerplate code, in which you have:
1. A section tag that consists of h2 heading.
2. Some preset CSS.
Don't change any of the boilerplate code.

What you need to do?

You need to style h2 such that it looks this way:

<IMAGE GOES HERE>

To achieve this, you have to write CSS as per the instructions given below.

For h2:
1. font size is set to '30px' and color is set as 'gray'
2. text transform property is utilised to make the entire heading 'uppercase'

For making the underline, we use h2::after to make content after the h2 element,
Inside which:
1. content propety is set to "" (an empty string)
2. color property is set to '#f63854'
3. display property is set to 'block'
4. border-bottom has value of solid
5. and it has a margin from top and bottom of 30px and right and left of 65px.

<!-- Hint:
The solution is quite straight forward. Pay attention to the instructions provided in the problem description and test cases.
For making the underline use:
h2::after{
    ...style rules
}

For making the text uppercase use:
text-transform: uppercase;
  -->

<!-- getComputedStyle(h2, ':after') -->

<!-- Test cases:
1. Verify that h2 has font-size of 30px and color as gray
2. Verify that h2 has text-transform with value set as 'uppercase'
3. Verify that h2::after has content property set to "" 
4. Verify that h2::after has color property set to #f63854
5. Verify that h2::after has display property set to block and border-bottom set as 'solid'
6. Verify that h2::after has margin property set to '30px 65px'-->
