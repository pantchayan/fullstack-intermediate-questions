<!-- Problem Description:

Create a Features section where features will be showcased with necessary headings, divs and Images with feature logos and feature description.

Use the following tags in proper flow:
1. <section> tag to hold all the content for the Feature Section
2. <h1> tag that holds the section heading of 'Awesome Features'
3. <div> tag that groups all the tags associated with a single feature
4. For each feature use -
4.1 <img> tag for feature's image
4.2 <h3> tag for feature's name
4.1 <p> tag for feature's description

Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.

Below is the basic structure of the expected output:
-->

<!-- Test cases: 
Verify that the webpage has a proper structure using the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Verify that the webpage has a <section> tag.
Verify that the webpage has a <h1> tag that contains the heading 'Awesome Features'.
Verify that the webpage has <div> tag that groups feature's components like <img>, <h3> and <p>.
-->

<!-- Hints:
Use the <section> tag that contains all the features' components.
Use the <h1> tag for section heading ‘Awesome Features’.
Group all the components for each feature in seperate <div> tags.
Use the <img> tag to add a logo for the feature.
Use the ‘src’ and ‘alt’ attributes of the <img> tag to specify the source and alternate text of the image respectively.
-->

<!-- Solution Approach:
Start by creating the basic structure of the HTML document using the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Add a <section> that will contain all the feature's components.
Use <h1> tag to specify the heading for the section as ‘Awesome Feeatures’.
Add a <div> tag, this will contain all the required feature components for a single feature.
Inside the <div> tag, add <img>, <h2> and <p> tags to specify feature’s logo, heading and description respectively.
Repeat the last two steps to add details for multiple features.
You can further divide and group different components under <div> tags as a good coding practice.
